pran
====

pran is a low-level tool to search .pcap files which contain telecom
signalling packets. It is mainly useful inside an Erlang program.

pran's approach to searching is: First, find all packets which match
the given binary search pattern. Second, decode the packets which were
found. This makes pran very fast in the important case of large .pcap
files and a binary search pattern which only matches a small number of
the packets in the file.


Examples
--------
```erlang
48> {ok,FD}=pran:open_file("mtp2.pcap", "").
{ok,<0.152.0>}
49> pran:read(FD).                          
[#frame{seq_no = 1,
        timestamp = {1234,378,932000},
        incl_payload_len = 5,orig_payload_len = 5,truncated = false,
        payload_bin = <<141,184,0,241,193>>},
 {mtp2,{fisu}}]
50> pran:read(FD).
[#frame{seq_no = 2,
        timestamp = {1234,379,764000},
        incl_payload_len = 36,orig_payload_len = 36,
        truncated = false,
        payload_bin = <<141,185,31,133,2,64,0,0,0,0,1,0,33,0,10,
                        2,2,8,6,1,16,...>>},
 {mtp2,#mtp2_msu{bsn = 13,bib = 1,fsn = 57,fib = 1,
                 sio = undefined,sif = undefined}},
 {mtp3,#mtp3_msu{ni = 2,prio = 0,si = isup,opc = 1,dpc = 2,
                 sls = 0}},
 {isup,<<0,0,1,0,33,0,10,2,2,8,6,1,16,18,82,85,33,10,6,7,
         1,17,19,...>>}]
51> pran:close(FD).                         
ok
